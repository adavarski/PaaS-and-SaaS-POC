### JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebooks environment


Jupyter Notebooks are a browser-based (or web-based) IDE (integrated development environments) applications that allows users to create, edit, run, and share their code with ease. This application gets its name from the main languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R.


Build custom JupyterLab docker image and pushing it into DockerHub container registry.
```
$ cd ./jupyterlab
$ docker build -t jupyterlab-eth .
$ docker tag jupyterlab-eth:latest davarski/jupyterlab-eth:latest
$ docker login 
$ docker push davarski/jupyterlab-eth:latest
```
Run Jupyter Notebook inside k8s as pod:

```
kubectl run -i -t jupyter-notebook --namespace=data --restart=Never --rm=true --env="JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes" --image=davarski/jupyterlab-eth:latest 

```
Example output:
```
davar@carbon:~$ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/k3s-config-jupyter 
davar@carbon:~$ kubectl run -i -t jupyter-notebook --namespace=data --restart=Never --rm=true --env="JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes" --image=davarski/jupyterlab-eth:latest

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-7-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://(jupyter-notebook or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=5bebb78cc162e7050332ce46371ca3adc82306fac0bc082a
```

Once the Pod is running, copy the generated token from the output logs. Jupyter Notebooks listen on port 8888 by default. In testing and demonstrations such as this, it is common to port-forward Pod containers directly to a local workstation rather than configure Services and Ingress. Caution Jupyter Notebooks intend and purposefully allow remote code execution. Exposing Jupyter Notebooks to public interfaces requires proper security considerations.

Port-forward the test-notebook Pod with the following command: 
``
kubectl port-forward jupyter-notebook 8888:8888 -n data
``
Browse to http://localhost:8888//?token=5bebb78cc162e7050332ce46371ca3adc82306fac0bc082a
